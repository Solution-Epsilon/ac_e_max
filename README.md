This repository is associated with the article 'Formation of Artificial Neural Assemblies by Biologically Plausible Inhibition Mechanisms'. It contains the following files:

AC_simulation: Python code with all simulations ready to run; you just need to uncomment the relevant sections.

plots_stats: Code for generating the graphs and performing statistical analysis. To run the code, simply uncomment the desired sections. Each part of the code corresponds to a figure in the article. The code file must be in the same folder as the data files, named 'dataset'.
